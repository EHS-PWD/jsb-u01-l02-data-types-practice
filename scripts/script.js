 PROBLEM 1 (CLASS DEMO): Favorite Things
===========================

üëâ Teacher-led demo ‚Äî follow along as a class!

Step 1: Create three variables about your favorite things:
   - favoriteColor (string)
   - favoriteNumber (number)
   - hasPet (boolean)

Step 2: Use typeof to log the type of each variable.

Step 3: Use a template literal to write a fun message that combines them.
   - Make it at least 2 lines
   - Example:
       My favorite color is blue.
       My favorite number is 7. Do I have a pet? true

   - whether you like pizza (boolean)

Step 2: Use console.log() and typeof to show the data type of each variable.

Step 3: Create another variable called car and assign it null.
Step 4: Log car and its type.
