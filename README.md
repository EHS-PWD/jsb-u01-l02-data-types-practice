### Unit 01 - Lab 02: Data Type Practice

#### **Objective:**

Students will have practiced creating variables with different JavaScript data types, including string, number, boolean, null, and undefined. They will have gained experience using the typeof operator to check and understand the type of data stored in variables. Students will have applied template literals to combine variables into readable, multi-line strings, and they will have compared the differences between null and undefined by explaining their meaning in their own words. Finally, students will have written simple, clear console outputs that demonstrate both values and data types in JavaScript.
